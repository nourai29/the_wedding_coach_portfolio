    quote: "You truly were instrumental in our wedding happening. I was so calm and relaxed because of you. We had stress with the handover but with you by our side kicking butt we were so grateful. You knew when people were taking advantage and when to stand up for us. You listened to our crazy ideas and accommodated us. No one could’ve warned you how crazy things would’ve gotten (wasn’t even on my spreadsheet) but it honestly was the best celebration we could’ve asked for!! Thank you again for the best day ever!!",
